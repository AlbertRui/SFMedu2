SFMedu: Structrue From Motion for Education Purpose


This code demonstrates how a traditional structure from motion pipeline is done and how to compute a dense point cloud by matching propagation in a simplest way. It is mainly designed for teaching a computer vision lecture at Princeton. Please check the slides and the homework assignment together with this code release. Although it is for education purpose, it is implemented in a nice way that it actually works for real photos. It is just probably quite slow compared to more optimized system, such as Bundler from Noah Snavely.

Usage: run SFMedu2.m in Matlab.
